# feyn-it-right
A Python program that takes an input and provides the user with a reading ease score. This is especially useful if you, like me, are living alone but would like to use the Feynman technique correctly.

Before running the program, you need to install a small library known as [`textstat`](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/). You can do so by running the following command: `pip install textstat`.
